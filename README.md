--undergoing revisions! 

This is a public repository. There are 2 ways you can work with this.

1. You can simply download a zip file of this repo by clicking on the option to the bottom right of the page. The problem with this method, is that your local copy (the one you downloaded) will not be dynamically updated with the one on the repository (if there are any changes in the future).

2. You can clone the repository, and keep pulling/fetching regularly to keep your local copy updated with the online one. Also, if you are interested, you can push code to resolve any bugs that you see.

##Matlab 
Add the path to the folder into your current working directory 

You can use the "help function_name" command to quickly look at the preferred I/O for the functions.

##Mathematica
Don't forget to run the package (button top right) before attempting to use the functions. Instructions on how to import the package automatically upon start-up of a notebook will follow soon and should be widely available online.

You can use function_name::usage to get a description of a function.
